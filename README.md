## How to use

We have (a work in progress) docs page, https://nullixat.github.io/framelix-docs/

## Main Features
* Built-In responsive backend - Don't worry about layout, build business logic.
* Full-featured form generator - Data manegement requires forms very often. We focused on that from the beginning.
* Built-In JS/SCSS compiler/bundler - Write newest JS code, automatically compiled to browser standards
* Model-View-Controller alike development - Kind of MVC but simplified and reduced to what is really required.
* Nearly 100% auto-completion support in your editor out of the box. We have some neat dev-tricks that you might have not known yet.
* Advanced ORM Database Features - You work with `Storables`, which are basically objects that are stored in the database. You can write raw queries but it's not required most of the time.
* Easy routing - We call our pages `Views`. A view is basically mapped to a URL. You can map a view to any URL you like.
* PHP 8.1 and higher - As this framework is pretty new, we are free to use latest technology for max performance and PHP features without worring about legacy support.
