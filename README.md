# Framelix Core
Framelix is a full-stack framework for PHP 8.1 and higher. It's main focus is to provide features for agile development of data management applications. A full featured responsive backend with a big set of features for your daily business in data manegement development.

## Pre-Alpha

This repository is currently in pre-alpha, in constant changes. I develop the core and tests from ground up. I let you know when there is something new to test it out. I will try to make some projects based on this framework available in early/mid 2022

## Submodule
This repository is only for developers. There are products and application that are based on this core, but this repository only contains the core module where you can start developing your own modules from.

## Main Features
* Built-In responsive backend - Don't worry about layout, build business logic.
* Full featured form generator - Data manegement requires forms very often. We focused on that from the beginning.
* Built-In JS/SCSS compiler/bundler - Write newest JS code, automatically compiled to browser standards
* Model-View-Controller alike development - Kind of MVC but simplified and reduced to what is really required.
* Nearly 100% auto-completion support in your editor out of the box. We have some neat dev-tricks that you might have not known yet.
* Advanced ORM Database Features - You work with `Storables`, which are basically objects that are stored in the database. You can write raw queries but it's not required most of the time.
* Easy routing - We call our pages `Views`. A view is basically mapped to a URL. You can map a view to any URL you like.
* PHP 8.1 and higher - As this framework is pretty new, we are free to use latest technology for max performance and PHP features without worring about legacy support.
